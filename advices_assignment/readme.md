### Advice retrieval and clustering
This is a corpus of advices prescribed by some doctors, you need to create an embedding-based document retriever, where given a query you need to retrieve the top-10 matches from the corpus. Additionally, also create way to visualize the embeddings from the corpus to get a sense of the entire dataset.
The embeddings can be from any model of your choice. You can use any libraries of your choice to accomplish this.
